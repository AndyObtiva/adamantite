# Adamantite

A local password manager written in Ruby. Passwords are encrypted and stored on your own
computer without ever sharing your master password or stored information over the internet.

You can use the gem by running the `adamantite` command in your terminal after downloading the gem. The window will appear on your screen (potentially not in the center of it, as that's a current limitation of the UI library it uses [Glimmer](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-libui).

Requires a valid license key to run.

There are two licenses: paid and free. You can buy a paid license by [visting this Stripe checkout page](https://buy.stripe.com/dR6g1e6wo8Z46acaEF). Once you complete the checkout, a license key will be emailed to the email address that you provide.

The license for the free tier is `2B1684-DDC9A4-DDDA73-57C45F-910645-V3`.
